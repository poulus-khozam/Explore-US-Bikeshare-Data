# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data (Udacity)
Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

<p>Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.</p>
<p>In this project, you will use data provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.motivateco.com/">Motivate</a>, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.</p>
<h2 id="the-datasets">The Datasets</h2>
<p>Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core <strong>six (6)</strong> columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)</li>
<li>End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)</li>
<li>Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)</li>
<li>Start Station (e.g., Broadway &amp; Barry Ave)</li>
<li>End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St &amp; North Ave)</li>
<li>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Birth Year</li>
</ul>
